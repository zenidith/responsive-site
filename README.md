This project was a really fun one where I focused on honing my responsive design skills by looking at a [design spec](https://xd.adobe.com/spec/75d448ea-569a-4b7e-721b-9bbd3b2b97b9-03e5/grid) initially and then breaking it down. I started off by coding the Nav responsively first then systematically broke down the different sections of the website and made them responsive to display the mobile version when minimized to a certain width. Then, I flipped it around to display the desktop version if maximized to a certain width. This technique is designed to start thinking responsively from the beginning.ðŸ’¡ 

After that, I broke up the different pages and ensured that they were all working. I put different padding on articles and border bottom on the side widget articles. Another feature that I added was the highlighting the current page to ensure easy naviation. 


Features that I covered in this project:
- flexbox
- justify-content and align items (for nav bar and containers)
- flex-direction (switching the main axis)
- media queries (to use on several size screens)
- build and style navigation

Happy Coding!
